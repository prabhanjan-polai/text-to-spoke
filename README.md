## 🛠️ Notes

- The app uses `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` for voice output.
- Some button labels and functions (like `fuck()`) are intentionally humorous but may be inappropriate in formal settings. Feel free to modify or remove them as needed.
- Minor typos in HTML (`text-aling`, `greer`, `contener`) can be corrected for better readability and styling.

## 🎨 Suggested Improvements

- Fix CSS styling issues (e.g., `text-align` instead of `text-aling`).
- Replace or rename sensitive functions for broader audience use.
- Add styling with external CSS for better visual appeal.
- Validate inputs and improve accessibility.
